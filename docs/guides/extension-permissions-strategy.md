# Extension Permissions Strategy

A strategic approach to Chrome extension permissions that balances functionality with user trust and install conversion.

## Principle of Least Privilege

Request only the minimum permissions your extension needs to function. Users and Chrome are increasingly security-conscious, and every requested permission signals risk. Design your extension architecture around minimal access—break features into modules that request permissions only when those specific features are invoked.

## Required vs Optional Permissions

**Required permissions** go in the `permissions` array in manifest.json. These are granted at install time and cannot be revoked by users without uninstalling. Use required permissions only for core functionality that the extension cannot work without.

**Optional permissions** go in `optional_permissions` and are requested at runtime via `chrome.permissions.request()`. These dramatically improve install conversion because users see fewer scary warnings. Request optional permissions only when the user explicitly enables a feature that needs them:

```json
{
  "optional_permissions": ["tabs", "bookmarks", "storage"]
}
```

## Impact on Install Rate

Fewer permissions directly correlate with higher install conversion rates. Extensions requesting broad host permissions (`<all_urls>` or `*://*/*`) display alarming warnings that can reduce installs by 50% or more. Users are increasingly educated about permission risks and will abandon extensions that request more than they need.

## Permission Warnings: What Triggers What

Certain permissions trigger prominent warnings in the Chrome Web Store:
- **"Read and change all your data on all websites"** — broad host permissions like `<all_urls>`, `*://*/*`
- **"Read and change your browsing activity"** — `tabs`, `webNavigation`, `webRequest`
- **"Manage your apps, extensions, and themes"** — `management` API
- **"Access to data on all domains"** — `cookies` with host permissions

Minimize warnings by:
1. Using specific host patterns instead of wildcards
2. Using `activeTab` instead of broad tab access
3. Moving permissions to optional when possible
4. Avoiding host permissions entirely when `activeTab` suffices

## Using activeTab Instead of Broad Host Permissions

The `activeTab` permission grants temporary access to the current tab only when the user invokes your extension (clicks the icon or uses a keyboard shortcut). This displays no scary warnings and provides a user-initiated trust model:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["activeTab"]
}
```

When granted, `activeTab` provides access to:
- Inject content scripts
- Access tab URL, title, favicon
- Use `scripting` API to manipulate the page

This is ideal for most content manipulation extensions that only need to act on the current page.

## Optional Permissions with chrome.permissions.request()

Request optional permissions dynamically when features are used:

```javascript
async function enableFeature(feature) {
  const permissions = { permissions: feature.requiredPermissions };
  
  const granted = await chrome.permissions.request(permissions);
  if (granted) {
    console.log('Permission granted');
    // Enable the feature
  } else {
    console.log('Permission denied');
    // Show graceful fallback UI
  }
}
```

Always explain why you need the permission before requesting—use a modal or prompt that describes the benefit.

## Permission Groups: Silent vs Approved

**Silently granted** (no prompt):
- `storage`
- `alarms`
- `contextMenus`
- `idle`
- `unlimitedStorage`

**Require user approval**:
- All host permissions
- `tabs`, `webNavigation`, `webRequest`
- `bookmarks`, `history`, `downloads`
- Optional permissions requested at runtime

## Runtime Permission Checking

Always check if you have the permissions you need before performing actions:

```javascript
async function checkPermission(permission) {
  const result = await chrome.permissions.contains({ permissions: [permission] });
  return result;
}

// Check before accessing restricted APIs
const hasTabs = await chrome.permissions.contains({ permissions: ['tabs'] });
if (!hasTabs) {
  // Gracefully degrade - use activeTab or request permission
}
```

## Graceful Degradation When Permissions Denied

Design your extension to function (albeit with reduced features) when permissions are denied:

```javascript
async function performAction() {
  if (!await hasRequiredPermission('bookmarks')) {
    showFeatureLimitedMessage('Enable bookmarks access in extension settings');
    return;
  }
  // Proceed with full functionality
}
```

Provide clear UI paths for users to grant permissions later via `chrome.runtime.openOptionsPage()`.

## Permission Removal for Unused Permissions

Release permissions when they're no longer needed to maintain user trust:

```javascript
chrome.permissions.remove({ permissions: ['tabs'] }, (removed) => {
  if (removed) {
    console.log('Permission removed');
  }
});
```

This is rare but useful when features are disabled or uninstalled.

## Enterprise Permissions via Policy

Organizations can push permissions via enterprise policy that users cannot revoke. If your extension targets enterprise deployment, document which permissions require policy enforcement:

- Host permissions via `allowed_hosts` policy
- API permissions that require admin approval

See [enterprise-extensions](./enterprise-extensions.md) for implementation details.

## Permission Justification for Chrome Web Store Review

During Chrome Web Store review, be prepared to justify:
1. Why each permission is necessary for core functionality
2. How data accessed by each permission is used and protected
3. Whether permissions can be made optional
4. What happens when permissions are denied

Provide clear, honest descriptions in your store listing and extension settings.
